# MedSelect Web Prototype

The goal of this project was to develop basic web programming skills and understand the process of developing a website based on a digital prototype designed with Figma. This prototype is a semi-functioning website that depicts the necessary user interface components of the MedSelect tool.

The purpose of the MedSelect tool is to allow a user (1) to find generic alternatives to brand-name medicine and (2) to read verified reviews that share the experience of people who have taken the medicine.

## MedSelect Alternatives
The alternatives feature shares generic alternatives to a brand-name medicine by doing drug comparisons. 

For demonstration purposes, in the search bar of the home page, type "welchol" and select the first icon in the search bar.

It will lead you to the alternatives page where you can see two cards side by side. The right card shows possible alternatives to the brand-name medicine. If there are multiple options, you can click the "PREV" or "NEXT" buttons to view those options. 

This feature currently uses JavaScript to fetch data from a text file and display the alternatives for the given example. In a fully functioning website, a database will be needed to fetch data based on the given input.

## MedSelect Reviews
The reviews feature shares verified reviews about a medicine written by registered users.

For demonstration purposes, in the search bar of the current page or the home page, type "colesevelam hci" and select the second icon in the search bar. 

It will lead you to the reviews page where you can see general information about the medicine on the left side and reviews on the right side.
